# Movie Cruiser App - The Starter Code

The Movie Cruiser app helps you search movies over the Internet and save your favorite movies in a watchlist. The Movie app is built using the following Tech Stack:
- Angular.io as the Front end
- Java + Spring Boot as the Backend
- MySQL as a data store

You can familiarize yourself with the working app through the following set of [screenshots and instructions.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ggbzCo04QSb8obLSJp7OtiQFlwgirgUnElHp-ERKC50)

This source code of this app is not complete and need some functionaility to be implemented as described in [ PROBLEM.md ](/PROBLEM.md) in this repository. 

To start working using the source code provided, you first need to download the code in your machine.
Download the source code by running the following command:

```git clone https://gitlab-dev.stackroute.in/<yourusername>/movie-cruiser.git```

Once the above repository (refer to the repository structure given below) is cloned on your local machine, perform the following steps to configure the same on your machine.

## Setting up the project in your machine

1. Ensure you have MySQL Server installed and running on your machine
2. Create an empty schema in MySQL to be used by this application along with a user account through which our application can connect to that schema (you will be adding data to this schema as you run the application).  
3. Update ```env-variables.sh``` with the schema name, username, password for MySQL and run `. ./env-variables.sh` to set necessary the environment variables as these would be required in your backend server application code.  
4. To start the backend, run `mvn package` and then `npm run spring-boot:run` in the same terminal as Step 3.  
5. To start the frontend, run `npm install` and then `npm run start` in a different terminal.  

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the running application which should look as shown in the [screenshots](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ggbzCo04QSb8obLSJp7OtiQFlwgirgUnElHp-ERKC50) shared above as well.
